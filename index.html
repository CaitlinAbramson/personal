			Welcome to my page! If you're here, you're probably looking to learn a little bit more about who I am. Currently, I am a fourth year at the University of Virginia studying Cognitive Science (concentrating in Computer Science) and Social Entrepreneurship. As an aspiring developer with an understanding of design, I believe colors are sometimes better at created personality than words. Below is the color palette I used for this site, which was carefully picked to also reflect who I am.

			Yellow: as an extrovert, I felt I was well-represented with yellow. It is not an in-your-face kind of yellow, but instead, it feels welcoming and cozy, like I do when reading a book or writing. It feels lively and energetic, like I do when talking to friends or listening to music or a good podcast. <br> <br>

			Orange: creativity wasn't something I thought had until college, when I discovered it lay within my thought process and passion for design. I am constantly taking note of how something looks, how it works, and how I interact with it. While I admire good design, I also love to envision ways to make bad design better. This includes anything from interior design to apps to products to organziation. <br> <br>

			Dark Blue: to balance my creativity, I am analytical. I have always been drawn to science. I like the hard evidence it requires. Psychology and neuroscience should inform design - we are building for inate human interaction. <br> <br>

			Light Blue: sure, curiosity may kill the cat, but without a curious mind and without asking questions, everything remains as is. I want to help improve the status quo, and so, I try to not put limits on my ideas and imagination. <br> <br>

			Gray: What do I want to get done today? What do I want to do for others? What do I want to do for myself? I work to be resourceful with my days. I like my sleep, so I have about 16 hours every day, which is more than enough time to make it a good one. <br> <br>

					As part of the Design Team at Cierant Corporation, I gained experience working with all aspects of the UX lifecycle. I conducted research to learn about users' pain points and created user personas and scenarios to inform our design. During team meetings, we created group sketches, which I then turned into wireframes and prototypes, using Adobe XD and Pop by Marvel. I presented these designs to clients and included them within our specification documents. 
					<br> <br>
					With my 2 years at Cierant, I learned the importance of understanding users' needs and designing before development. We have begun the process of shifting from a develop-then-design mentality to one that includes iterative steps of design, development, and stakeholder communication.

					I am currently in the process creating an internal Design and Code Library so that it is easier to keep applications stylistically similar and avoid recreating custom solutions. This library will provide snippets of code written in pure HTML/CSS, for Angular and JavaScript frameworks, and in C#. This project will involve modifying and updating code to match modern design standards and our company's branding vision. <br> <br>
					I also worked on a front-end project in which I helped set-up, structure, and customize a WordPress site that will be used as marketing and promotional material for one of our applications. Using a Genesis framework with a child theme, plug-ins, and custom HTML and CSS, I established a general structure and workflow for the final site.

					As part of the effort to revolutionize the company's workflow, I redesigned the structure and procedure for writing business and technical requirement documents. The documents include annotated wireframes or prototypes, followed by user stores, and depending on the project, sprint tasks for developers. This document serves as a platform for communication and compromise between the developers and stakeholders. While writing these documents myself, I worked closely with developers to ensure we were promising a minimal viable product that was reasonable and within budget.

					In addition to changing the documentation process, I helped to create a new QA Testing system. I researched typical procedures and designed a SmartSheet and Excel guideline and template. Any future large or full-system testing task began with adapting the testing template to fit the application's architecture. After this template proved to work well, I used it to test applications I helped design.

					As a research assistant, I ran trials and collected data for two experiments. The first was an EEG study examining the effects of cognitive and emotional regulation techniques. The second experiment studied the effect of a positive, negative, or neutral visual imagery on one's tolerance of an ice-water stressor task. 
					<br> <br>
					Being a research assistant helped me to realize my passion for being involved with the application of research. My boss introduced me to the field of User Experience for the first time. It excited me to find a way to combine neurological and psychological research with modern technological advancements.

					I worked with a team to help rebrand a vegan and allergen-friendly energy product. This included analyzing survey and in-store experimentation results. With a persona and user data in mind, we combined a few design elements together to create the final packaging. 
					<br> <br>
					Additionally, to help increase product awareness, I worked to create a social media prescence on Instagram and Facebook. I established a guideline for the types of posts we thought would best target our main persona. This included media marketing strategies, emotional reactions we wanted from end-users, and content planning. Additionally, I set up and ran a spreadsheet calendar to keep posts organized and on-schedule.
