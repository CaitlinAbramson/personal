			Welcome to my page! If you're here, you're probably looking to learn a little bit more about who I am. Currently, I am a fourth year at the University of Virginia studying Cognitive Science (concentrating in Computer Science) and Social Entrepreneurship. As an aspiring developer with an understanding of design, I believe colors are sometimes better at creating personality than words. Below is the color palette I used for this site, which was carefully picked to also reflect who I am.

		<p class = "about_me_intro">
			Yellow: as an extrovert, I felt I was well-represented with yellow. It is not an in-your-face kind of yellow, but instead, it feels welcoming and cozy, like I do when reading a book or writing. It feels lively and energetic, like I do when talking to friends or listening to music or a good podcast. <br> <br>

			Orange: creativity wasn't something I thought had until college, when I discovered it lay within my thought process and passion for design. I am constantly taking note of how something looks, how it works, and how I interact with it. While I admire good design, I also love to envision ways to make bad design better. This includes anything from interior design to apps to products to organziation. <br> <br>

			Dark Blue: to balance my creativity, I am analytical. I have always been drawn to science. I like the hard evidence it requires. Psychology and neuroscience should inform design - we are building for inate human interaction. <br> <br>

			Light Blue: sure, curiosity may kill the cat, but without a curious mind and without asking questions, everything remains as is. I want to help improve the status quo, and so, I try to not put limits on my ideas and imagination. <br> <br>

			Gray: What do I want to get done today? What do I want to do for others? What do I want to do for myself? I work to be resourceful with my days. I like my sleep, so I have about 16 hours every day, which is more than enough time to make it a good one. <br> <br>

					As part of the Design Team at Cierant Corporation, I gained experience working with all aspects of the UX lifecycle. I conducted research to learn about users' pain points and created user personas and scenarios to inform our design. During team meetings, we created group sketches, which I then turned into wireframes and prototypes, using Adobe XD and Pop by Marvel. I presented these designs to clients and included them within our specification documents. 
					<br> <br>
					With my 2 years at Cierant, I learned the importance of understanding users' needs and designing before development. We have begun the process of shifting from a develop-then-design mentality to one that includes iterative steps of design, development, and stakeholder communication.

					I am currently in the process creating an internal Design and Code Library so that it is easier to keep applications stylistically similar and avoid recreating custom solutions. This library will provide snippets of code written in pure HTML/CSS, for Angular and JavaScript frameworks, and in C#. This project will involve modifying and updating code to match modern design standards and our company's branding vision. <br> <br>
					I also worked on a front-end project in which I helped set-up, structure, and customize a WordPress site that will be used as marketing and promotional material for one of our applications. Using a Genesis framework with a child theme, plug-ins, and custom HTML and CSS, I established a general structure and workflow for the final site.

					As part of the effort to revolutionize the company's workflow, I redesigned the structure and procedure for writing business and technical requirement documents. The documents include annotated wireframes or prototypes, followed by user stores, and depending on the project, sprint tasks for developers. This document serves as a platform for communication and compromise between the developers and stakeholders. While writing these documents myself, I worked closely with developers to ensure we were promising a minimal viable product that was reasonable and within budget.

					In addition to changing the documentation process, I helped to create a new QA Testing system. I researched typical procedures and designed a SmartSheet and Excel guideline and template. Any future large or full-system testing task began with adapting the testing template to fit the application's architecture. After this template proved to work well, I used it to test applications I helped design.

					As a research assistant, I ran trials and collected data for two experiments. The first was an EEG study examining the effects of cognitive and emotional regulation techniques. The second experiment studied the effect of a positive, negative, or neutral visual imagery on one's tolerance of an ice-water stressor task. 
					<br> <br>
					Being a research assistant helped me to realize my passion for being involved with the application of research. My boss introduced me to the field of User Experience for the first time. It excited me to find a way to combine neurological and psychological research with modern technological advancements.

					I worked with a team to help rebrand a vegan and allergen-friendly energy product. This included analyzing survey and in-store experimentation results. With a persona and user data in mind, we combined a few design elements together to create the final packaging. 
					<br> <br>
					Additionally, to help increase product awareness, I worked to create a social media prescence on Instagram and Facebook. I established a guideline for the types of posts we thought would best target our main persona. This included media marketing strategies, emotional reactions we wanted from end-users, and content planning. Additionally, I set up and ran a spreadsheet calendar to keep posts organized and on-schedule.

				<h4> Workout App Mood Board </h4>
				<p>
					When I was looking to find a workout app to help track my workouts and progress, I discovered a lot of them were not flexible and had an "intense" look-and-feel (think neon green and black). I had a vision for an app that left you feeling energized and clean, like how I feel after a workout. I created this mood board to capture that aesthetic.

				<h4> Workout App Wireframe </h4>

					Before playing with the look-and-feel, I created a minimal wireframe to sketch out the framework and
					functionality of my screens. This screen represents the timeline view to track workout history.

					Combining my mood board and my wireframe, I created a high-fidelity prototype. To me, this piece is always a work-in-progress. I like to revise it, experiment with new ideas, design trends, and prototyping software techniques. This app has been a way for me to see my growth as a UX/UI designer.

				<h4> MetaBall Rebranding </h4>
				<p>
					MetaBall Energy Bites is a family-owned product, and in 2017, we decided to rebrand the product. To see the old packaging for comparison, click <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2024/0675/products/074677531204_C1N1_300x300.jpg?v=1556307988">here</a>.
					I helped create sketches and design components, and a contracted designer produced a number of packaging options. To help learn which packaging is most attractive to our target population best, we sent out a survey in which potential buyers ranked the designs. We also did in-store experimentation to analyze the designs that stood out on the shelves best. With these results, we created the final packaging which combined elements from a few of the design options.
					<br> <br> <br> 
					With the new packaging, we needed our <a href="https://www.metaballenergybites.com/">website</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/metaballenergybites/?hl=en">social media</a> to match the branding. I contributed to the web design meetings, talking to developers and user experience designers to create a realistic plan for the new site. With each version of the site delivered to us, I helped test for bugs and tweak design elements. For our social media sites, I created a content guideline to make sure our posts are directed towards our intended consumers. I also developed a calendar to plan out posts and timing.

				<h4> DIY Pack Low-Fidelity Prototype </h4>
				<p>
					For this project, we were given an existing style guide, but no UX or user pathways. I received this project 4 hours before it was to be presented on a client call. We needed to demonstrate two separate paths: a fully customized box and a template-based box. This screen is part of the template-based experience. I wanted to create a low-fidelity prototype instead of a wireframe because I wanted to show the client we were taking their branding and aesthetics into consideration; it wasn't just about the functionality.
					<br> <br>
					I had a few constraints on my design. Our developers were implementing XMPie software, and our budget did not allow for much customization of its out-of-the-box UX or UI. By speaking to our developers and understanding our client's requirements, I was able to quickly create this design and meet everyone's needs. The final deliverable was a low-fidelity clickable prototype (using Adobe XD).

				<h4> Interview Connect </h4>
				<p>
					This was a project for my Human Computer Interaction (HCI) course. The problem I identified was the lack of free interview preparation and feedback for people who are out of college or prefer practicing from the comfort of their own home. This website functions as a forum, where interview questions will be posted and users can upload video or audio responses. Then, other users can review their answers based on a general rubric.
